# PVerlet

Velocity Verlet Integration in Processing with Uniform Spatial Grid lookup optimization

A sample algorithm of Velocity Verlet Integration, a physics simulation algorithm that is more accurate than Euler integration.
Includes a grid lookup (spatial partitioning) optimization, and a few other optimizations.
Includes options for running the simulation in different ways with a GUI.
